# Agility GCP Terraform ATC Lab
Agility lab demonstrating launching BIG-IP in Google Cloud Platform leveraging Terraform and the F5 Automation Toolchain

## For students
Ensure that you can access [Google cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas/qirs?project=f5-gcs-4261-sales-agility2022) If you cannot access this, then notify the lab staff and join them in a breakout room to resolve this issue.

Please get your assigned student number from the lab staff and modify the [variables.tf](variables.tf) file replacing the comment with your number.

All json files for your labs will be built in the [ATC_Declarations](ATC_Declarations/) folder.  Many of you files will be built as part of the terraform apply, but there are a few helper json files in these directories as well.

## Lab Staff
Ensure you have a Project in the GCP account that can be used for the lab.
Review the [foundations readme](foundations/README.md) for additional work before the start of the lab.
